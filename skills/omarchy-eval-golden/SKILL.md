  The omarchy evaluation GOLDEN VM chain runbook — provision/re-provision of the

# omarchy-eval-golden — the golden VM chain

The golden chain lives in opencharly/eval-omarchy/charly.yml (the single source of
config): `omarchy-vm` (ISO template) → `check-omarchy-eval-base` (provisions + captures
`golden` snapshot) → `check-omarchy-eval-base-inst` (the INSTRUMENTED golden: charly,
autologin, record tools incl. acpid, pr-apply, pre-seeded eval-head objects, warmed
charly cache — captured as its own golden). Per-PR evals clone from the instrumented
golden (`source.kind: clone`, `from_snapshot: golden`).

VM mechanics (snapshots, clones, disposability, spice graphics) are owned by
`/charly-vm:vm` and `/charly-internals:disposable` — this skill covers ONLY the
repo-specific chain.

## The fresh lane (provision / re-provision)

1. Delete-before-recapture, BOTH snapshot states (measured gap):
   - the charly store: remove `snapshots/golden/` + the stale `registry.json` entry; AND
   - the LIBVIRT metadata: `virsh -c qemu:///session snapshot-delete <domain> golden --metadata`
     (`charly vm snapshot delete` misses libvirt metadata once the disk is gone →
     `cannot delete inactive domain with 1 snapshots` / `domain already exists`).
2. `charly vm destroy <bed> --domain <bed>`, then run the FRESH lane (the eval-base /
   eval-base-inst beds), then `charly vm stop <bed> --domain <bed> --force` so the golden
   is never held exclusively.
3. VERIFY `snapshots/golden/disk.qcow2` exists after capture — a missing golden after
   capture is a BLOCK, never a teardown.
4. A FRESH lane re-capture bakes the current omarchy channel state (full system upgrade
   + channel update run inside the instrumented base). Re-provision whenever the
   channel state or the pre-seeded eval-head set must move.

## Per-PR clones

- Clone entity: `source.kind: clone`, `from_vm: check-omarchy-eval-base-inst`,
  `from_snapshot: golden` — oracle-generated per PR into `pr-beds/pr-<N>/charly.yml`
  (never hand-edited; `charly box validate` gate).
- RED-PROBE twin bed: same checks, NO apply — must FAIL on the golden (every PR check
  known-red). Exit 0 on the probe = non-red check or stale golden = PROCESS finding.
- A FAIL leaves the VM running (by design, for debugging). Destroy + confirm domstate
  gone before the next run on the same clone disk.

## Head-freshness

Before ANY eval run, compare the plan's headSha with the LIVE PR head
(`gh api repos/omacom/omarchy/pulls/<N> .head.sha`) — a force-pushed upstream head
orphans the pinned head and pr-apply fails. On mismatch: STOP and regenerate the bed.

Pointers: the full per-PR lane contract is `opencharly/eval-omarchy`
`eval/PR-EVAL-LANE.md` (+ `eval/references/*.md`); general eval procedure is
`/charly-distros:omarchy-eval`.
